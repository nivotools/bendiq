  { id: 1, question: "Why is my offset always coming up short?", answer: "You likely forgot the Shrink. The pipe travels a longer distance on the hypotenuse. For a 30° bend, add 1/4\" to your starting mark for every inch of rise." },
  { id: 2, question: "What is the multiplier for a 30° bend?", answer: "Exactly 2. If you need a 6-inch offset, the distance between bend marks is 12 inches." },
  { id: 3, question: "Fastest way to fix a dog-leg?", answer: "Lay the pipe flat on the floor. Rotate it so the twisted part is facing up, then use your bender handle or channel locks to torque it back down until it lays flat against the concrete." },
  { id: 4, question: "When should I use a 4-Point Saddle instead of a 3-Point?", answer: "Use a 4-Point for wide or square obstacles (like beams). It clears wider gaps more cleanly than a 3-point peak." },
  { id: 5, question: "What does the 'Star' symbol on the bender mean?", answer: "That is the 'Back of Bend' mark. Use it primarily for measuring and bending back-to-back 90s." },
  { id: 6, question: "How do I handle Spring-Back on Rigid pipe?", answer: "You must over-bend slightly. To get a perfect 90°, bend it to roughly 87° or 88° under tension; it will relax to 90° when released." },
  { id: 7, question: "What is 'Gain'?", answer: "Gain is the distance 'saved' by bending in an arc around a corner rather than going square into it. It means you use slightly less pipe than the measured corner distance." },
  { id: 8, question: "What is the shrink per inch of rise for a 45° offset?", answer: "Approximately 3/8\" per inch of rise." },
  { id: 9, question: "Center-to-Center vs. Back-to-Back measurements?", answer: "Center-to-Center is crucial for uniform spacing in a rack of pipes. Back-to-Back is used for measuring the total outside dimension of a U-shape or between two 90s." },
  { id: 10, question: "Why do my concentric bends look messy?", answer: "You aren't adjusting the starting marks. As you move outward in a rack corner, you must increase the distance of your starting mark for each subsequent pipe to maintain uniform spacing." },
  { id: 11, question: "Why should you always bend your 'Stub-up' first?", answer: "It's the hardest bend to adjust. If you start with the 90, you can trim the other end of the pipe to fit your second mark perfectly." },
  { id: 12, question: "What's the 'Eye-Ball' test for a perfect rack?", answer: "Stand at the end of the run and look through the pipes. If you see one 'shadow' overlapping another, your spacing is off." },
  { id: 13, question: "How do you calculate the 'Center' of a 4-point saddle?", answer: "It's the middle point between your two inner bends. Mark the center of the obstacle, then move half your obstacle width in both directions." },
  { id: 14, question: "What is the 'Rule of 6' for shallow offsets?", answer: "For a 10° bend, the multiplier is 6. It's the smoothest, easiest-to-pull offset for tight spaces." },
  { id: 15, question: "How do you avoid 'Crushing' thin-wall EMT?", answer: "Keep your foot pressure heavy on the bender shoe, not the handle. The shoe shapes the pipe; the handle just provides leverage." },
  { id: 16, question: "What is 'Total Degrees of Bend' in a run?", answer: "The NEC limit is 360°. That's four 90s. Any more, and the wire pull becomes a code violation and a physical nightmare." },
  { id: 17, question: "Why use a 'Kick' instead of an 'Offset'?", answer: "Use a kick when you only need to change elevation at the very end of a run to enter a box. It saves a bend and looks cleaner." },
  { id: 18, question: "How do you measure for a 'Back-to-Back' 90?", answer: "Measure from the back of the first 90 to the wall. Mark that distance and align the Star on your bender with that mark." },
  { id: 19, question: "What's the easiest way to find the center of a pipe?", answer: "Use a piece of angle iron. Lay it on the pipe; the 'V' shape automatically finds the true top-center for your marks." },
  { id: 20, question: "Why does 'Pipe Spacing' change in a turn?", answer: "Because the radius of the outer pipe is larger. To keep them looking parallel, you must calculate Concentric math." },
  { id: 21, question: "Why is 30° the most common offset angle?", answer: "Because the multiplier is a clean 2.0. No decimals, no complex math, and it's easy to pull wire through." },
  { id: 22, question: "How much shrink occurs in a 30° offset?", answer: "1/4 inch for every inch of offset depth. A 4-inch offset means the pipe shrinks 1 inch total." },
  { id: 23, question: "If my offset is 8 inches at 30°, what is the distance between marks?", answer: "16 inches. Simply height (8) multiplied by the 30° constant (2)." },
  { id: 24, question: "Where should my first mark be for a 30° offset?", answer: "Obstacle distance + Shrink. If the obstacle is 20\" away and 4\" high, your first mark is at 21\"." },
  { id: 25, question: "Can I use 30° for a 3-point saddle?", answer: "Yes! Use 30° for the center and 15° for the sides. The multiplier stays 2.0, making the layout math effortless." },
  { id: 26, question: "What if I over-bend a 90?", answer: "Slide your bender handle over the pipe end, put your foot on the back of the bend, and pull back gently to open the angle." },
  { id: 27, question: "How do I mark pipe that is greasy or wet?", answer: "Use a paint pen or a 'China Marker' (grease pencil). Standard markers will fail instantly on oily GRC." },
  { id: 28, question: "My pipe won't fit in the bender shoe! Why?", answer: "You might be using an incorrect bender size or there is debris like a pebble stuck in the shoe. Always check the shoe for obstructions." },
  { id: 29, question: "How do you fix a 'Kinked' pipe?", answer: "You don't. Once the wall collapses, it's scrap. Trying to fix it compromises the interior volume and structural integrity." },
  { id: 30, question: "How do you align a second bend in a long run?", answer: "Use a 'No-Dog' level. It clips onto the pipe and ensures your second bend is on the same plane as the first." },
  { id: 31, question: "What is a 'Rolling Offset'?", answer: "An offset that changes both vertical height and horizontal position simultaneously to reach a destination." },
  { id: 32, question: "How do you find the 'True Rise' of a rolling offset?", answer: "Use the Pythagorean theorem: Rise² + Width² = TrueRise². This True Rise is what you use for your multiplier math." },
  { id: 33, question: "What is 'Segment Bending'?", answer: "Making a large radius curve by performing many small, 5-degree bends every few inches along a stretch of conduit." },
  { id: 34, question: "How do you keep spacing identical in a 90° rack?", answer: "Add 1.5 times the width of the spacing to each successive pipe's 'Take-up' measurement as you move outward." },
  { id: 35, question: "When do you use a 22.5° bend?", answer: "When you want a shallow, professional offset. The multiplier is 2.6, offering a smoother pull than a 30° or 45°." },
  { id: 36, question: "Why use 10° bends in a hospital?", answer: "Sensitive data cables (Cat6A) hate sharp turns. Shallow bends protect the 'Bend Radius' required for high-speed signal integrity." },
  { id: 37, question: "What is a 'Compound Bend'?", answer: "The ultimate challenge: a single piece of conduit that combines a 90° turn with an integrated offset." },
  { id: 38, question: "What is a 45° offset multiplier?", answer: "The multiplier is 1.4. It's fast to bend but creates significantly more friction for wire pulling than 30°." },
  { id: 39, question: "What is 'Object Clearance'?", answer: "Always add 1/4\" to 1/2\" to your offset height. This ensures the pipe clears the obstacle without actually touching it." },
  { id: 40, question: "How do you measure 'Total Run Length'?", answer: "Measure all straight sections and add the 'Gain' for every 90° bend to find the total length of pipe needed." },
  { id: 41, question: "Why shouldn't you use a 3/4\" bender for 1/2\" pipe?", answer: "The shoe won't support the pipe walls correctly, which almost always results in a kink or a flat spot in the bend." },
  { id: 42, question: "How often should you check your level?", answer: "Every morning. If you drop a torpedo level once, its accuracy can shift, ruining your 'perfect' 90-degree stubs." },
  { id: 43, question: "What's the 'Handle Trick' for leverage?", answer: "If you're struggling with Rigid pipe, use a longer piece of threaded pipe as an extension handle for more torque." },
  { id: 44, question: "Why use a 'Foot-Back' bender?", answer: "They feature a wider base, making it easier to apply the consistent 'Heavy Foot' pressure required for clean results." },
  { id: 45, question: "Best way to carry 10 sticks of EMT?", answer: "Shoulder-carry them with a ratchet strap or bungee cord to prevent them from splaying out and losing balance." },
  { id: 46, question: "How do you mark a pipe in the dark?", answer: "Use reflective 'glow' tape or a high-visibility silver pencil that catches the light from your headlamp." },
  { id: 47, question: "Why is 'Deburring' essential?", answer: "Sharp edges from a cut will slice through wire insulation during the pull, causing immediate short circuits." },
  { id: 48, question: "What tool is best for deburring?", answer: "A dedicated conduit reamer is fastest, but the 'nose' of your side-cutting pliers (Kleins) works in a pinch." },
  { id: 49, question: "How do you bend conduit in the rain?", answer: "Carefully. Your foot can easily slip off the bender shoe, leading to missed bends or painful shin injuries." },
  { id: 50, question: "Why use a hydraulic bender for 2-inch pipe?", answer: "Because manual bending stops being feasible at 1-1/4\". Protect your back—let the hydraulics do the heavy lifting." },
  { id: 51, question: "What is 'IMC' conduit?", answer: "Intermediate Metal Conduit. It's lighter than GRC (Rigid) but significantly stronger and thicker than EMT." },
  { id: 52, question: "Can you bend PVC?", answer: "Yes, but only after heating it in a 'Hot Box' or with a heat blanket until it becomes pliable." },
  { id: 53, question: "What is 'Schedule 80' PVC?", answer: "Extra-thick wall PVC used for high-impact areas. It requires more heat and has more shrink than Schedule 40." },
  { id: 54, question: "Why does Aluminum pipe bend differently?", answer: "It's softer and 'galls' (scratches) easily. Ensure your bender shoe is clean to avoid damaging the conduit." },
  { id: 55, question: "What is 'Galvanizing'?", answer: "A zinc coating that prevents rust. If you scratch it too deeply while bending, the pipe will corrode over time." },
  { id: 56, question: "Can you bend 'Flex' (Greenfield)?", answer: "No. Flex is meant to be moved by hand. You use specific connectors and 90° fittings to change its direction." },
  { id: 57, question: "Why does conduit size refer to 'Inside Diameter'?", answer: "To ensure you know exactly how much 'Fill' (total wire cross-section) the pipe can safely accommodate." },
  { id: 58, question: "What is the multiplier for a 60° bend?", answer: "1.15. This is a very sharp bend that adds a lot of friction—only use it when space is extremely restricted." },
  { id: 59, question: "How do you identify 1/2\" vs 3/4\" pipe?", answer: "Visual practice. 3/4\" is roughly the diameter of an adult thumb; 1/2\" is closer to the diameter of a pinky finger." },
  { id: 60, question: "What is 'Cold Bending' PVC?", answer: "Using an internal spring to bend PVC without heat. It's only suitable for very slight, gradual curves." },
  { id: 61, question: "How do you speed up a large rack installation?", answer: "Bend all 90s using a single template first, then mount and cut them to their final lengths once they are on the lift." },
  { id: 62, question: "What's the 'Crayon' trick?", answer: "Use different colored lumber crayons for different circuits during a pull to avoid confusion at the pull-box." },
  { id: 63, question: "How do you keep a bender from sliding on slick concrete?", answer: "Place a piece of scrap cardboard or a rubber kneeling mat under the bender head for extra grip." },
  { id: 64, question: "Why is a 'Torpedo Level' better than a long level?", answer: "It's pocket-sized and usually magnetized, allowing it to stick to the pipe while you focus on the bender handle." },
  { id: 65, question: "What's the 'Box Offset' cheat?", answer: "Use the slot in your bender handle—insert the pipe end and give it a quick pull for a perfect, uniform 1/2\" offset." },
  { id: 66, question: "How do you measure pipe length 'Through a wall'?", answer: "Push your fish tape through, mark it at the entry point, pull it back out, and measure the tape length." },
  { id: 67, question: "Why use 'Mineral Oil' on Rigid threads?", answer: "It allows the bender to pull smoother and prevents the threads from seizing when you tighten couplings." },
  { id: 68, question: "How do you bend conduit to match a sloped ceiling?", answer: "Use an inclinometer or a digital angle-finder app on your phone to match the exact pitch of the roof." },
  { id: 69, question: "What is 'Air Bending'?", answer: "Bending with the bender head in the air and handle on the floor. Good for small tweaks, but lacks the precision of floor bending." },
  { id: 70, question: "Why should you never 'Eye-Ball' a 90?", answer: "Because a single degree of error becomes glaringly obvious over a long run. Always use a level for 90s." },
  { id: 71, question: "How do you clean Sharpie marks off pipe?", answer: "Rubbing alcohol or PVC primer will dissolve the ink instantly, leaving your pipe clean for the final inspection." },
  { id: 72, question: "Why use 'One-Hole Straps'?", answer: "They allow for minor 'on-the-fly' adjustments during installation, whereas two-hole straps are unforgiving." },
  { id: 73, question: "How do you keep marks from being seen?", answer: "Always mark on the 'Bottom' of the conduit—the side that will face the ceiling once the pipe is hung." },
  { id: 74, question: "What is 'Conduit Support' code?", answer: "NEC usually requires support within 3 feet of a box and then at least every 10 feet for the rest of the run." },
  { id: 75, question: "How do you handle 'Expansion Joints'?", answer: "Use an S-bend or a dedicated telescoping expansion fitting for runs exceeding 100 feet to account for thermal movement." },
  { id: 76, question: "Why use 'Thread Glue' on conduit?", answer: "In high-vibration environments like factories, it prevents couplings from rattling loose over time." },
  { id: 77, question: "What's the 'Pull-String' trick?", answer: "Tie a plastic grocery bag to your string and use a shop vac at the other end to suck it through the pipe in seconds." },
  { id: 78, question: "How do you measure a bend's radius?", answer: "Measure from the imaginary center point of the turn's circle to the inner edge of the conduit wall." },
  { id: 79, question: "Why is 'Symmetry' the sign of a Master?", answer: "Anyone can pull a wire. A master treats conduit like architecture, ensuring every bend and parallel line is perfectly balanced." },
  { id: 80, question: "What's the best way to learn complex bends?", answer: "Practice on scrap. Try to fit a single 10-foot stick into a 3-dimensional corner. Failure is your best instructor." },
  { id: 81, question: "What causes my multiplier to be off?", answer: "Usually measuring to wrong point, or bend angle not being exact. Verify with a protractor." },
  { id: 82, question: "How do I handle obstructions mid-run?", answer: "Plan saddles or offsets in advance. Sometimes rerouting is easier than multiple complex bends." },
  { id: 83, question: "What's the key to concentric bends?", answer: "Each pipe in the rack has progressively larger marks. Add the spacing factor for each successive pipe." },
  { id: 84, question: "How do I calculate stagger for parallel offsets?", answer: "Stagger = Pipe Spacing × tan(Bend Angle ÷ 2). This keeps pipes parallel after the offset." },
  { id: 85, question: "What hand position gives best control?", answer: "Dominant hand on handle end, other hand stabilizing near the hook. Smooth, controlled pressure." },
  { id: 86, question: "How do I bend in cold weather?", answer: "Metal is more brittle. Warm the conduit if possible, and use slower, steadier bending motion." },
  { id: 87, question: "Can I re-bend conduit?", answer: "Minor adjustments yes, but multiple re-bends weaken the metal and can cause kinks." },
  { id: 88, question: "What's the purpose of the degree scale on benders?", answer: "Quick reference for common angles. Stop bending when the handle aligns with your target degree." },
  { id: 89, question: "How do I maintain my bender?", answer: "Keep it clean, occasionally wax the shoe, check for hook wear, and store properly." },
  { id: 90, question: "What's the secret to fast, accurate bending?", answer: "Memorize your multipliers and take-ups. Measure carefully, bend confidently." },
  // Fill remaining days with rotated/varied questions
  { id: 91, question: "How much does an offset affect total conduit length?", answer: "Add the shrink amount to your overall measurement. For 30° offset with 4\" rise, add 1\" to total length." },
  { id: 92, question: "What tool helps verify bend angles in the field?", answer: "An angle finder or digital protractor. Some phones have gyroscope-based angle apps." },
  { id: 93, question: "Why is my 4-point saddle wobbly?", answer: "The four bends aren't co-planar. Check that opposing bends are equal and pipe didn't rotate during bending." },
  { id: 94, question: "What's a quick sanity check for offsets?", answer: "Lay it on a flat surface. Both ends should touch the surface evenly with the offset rising smoothly." },
  { id: 95, question: "How do I handle different conduit sizes in one rack?", answer: "Bend each size separately using its correct bender. Plan the layout so all pipes align at common points." },
  { id: 96, question: "What's the most common beginner mistake?", answer: "Forgetting shrink on offsets. The pipe ends up short every time." },
  { id: 97, question: "How do I mark reference lines on the floor?", answer: "Use chalk lines or tape. Helps keep multiple pipe runs aligned and parallel." },
  { id: 98, question: "What's the 'developed length' of a 90°?", answer: "Arc length = π × Radius × (Angle/180). For a 5\" radius 90°, that's about 7.85\"." },
  { id: 99, question: "Why plan bends from the end of the run backward?", answer: "Easier to account for termination requirements and ensures last bend is accurate." },
  { id: 100, question: "What's the trick to consistent quality?", answer: "Develop a routine: measure, mark, verify, bend, check. Same process every time builds muscle memory." },
  // Continue pattern for remaining days...
  { id: 101, question: "How do I handle a bend that's slightly over-bent?", answer: "Use the bender reversed or a piece of pipe/channel to carefully push back. Small corrections only." },
  { id: 102, question: "What's causing my offset to twist?", answer: "The pipe rotated during one of the bends. Keep conduit pressed flat against the floor throughout." },
  { id: 103, question: "How precise does my bender placement need to be?", answer: "The arrow should be within 1/16\" of your mark for best results on short measurements." },
  { id: 104, question: "What's a 'reverse bend'?", answer: "A bend made in the opposite direction of a previous bend, like the second bend of an offset." },
  { id: 105, question: "How do I handle very small offsets?", answer: "Use 10° bends. Even 1/2\" offsets are possible with careful marking at 3\" apart." },
  { id: 106, question: "What's the maximum practical offset height?", answer: "Depends on conduit size. Generally 6-8\" for hand benders. Larger requires mechanical benders or box offsets." },
  { id: 107, question: "How do I support conduit while bending long pieces?", answer: "Use sawhorses or have a helper support the free end to prevent unwanted bends or kinks." },
  { id: 108, question: "What's a 'reverse stub'?", answer: "A 90° bend where the pipe goes down instead of up. Same technique, just oriented differently." },
  { id: 109, question: "How do I match the angle of an existing pipe?", answer: "Use an angle finder to measure, then replicate. Or use the existing pipe as a template." },
  { id: 110, question: "What's the benefit of 10° offsets?", answer: "Very gradual rise, easy wire pulling, minimal stress. Best for runs where space isn't limited." },
  // Add more to reach 365...
  { id: 111, question: "Why use 30° as the 'default' offset angle?", answer: "It's a good balance of rise distance and wire-pull ease. The 2× multiplier is easy math." },
  { id: 112, question: "What's different about bending rigid conduit?", answer: "More force required, significant spring-back, and usually requires a mechanical or hydraulic bender." },
  { id: 113, question: "Can I bend PVC conduit?", answer: "Yes, but requires a heat source (blanket or gun) to soften it first. Different tools and technique." },
  { id: 114, question: "What's 'running the rack'?", answer: "Installing multiple parallel conduits, typically with coordinated bends for a professional appearance." },
  { id: 115, question: "How do I calculate for expansion in long runs?", answer: "Use expansion fittings. PVC expands more than metal; check tables for your climate conditions." },
  { id: 116, question: "What's the minimum straight section between bends?", answer: "At least 6 times the conduit diameter for proper wire-pulling access." },
  { id: 117, question: "How do I bend into a tight corner?", answer: "May need a 90° with a kick, or two separate bends. Plan the sequence before starting." },

  { id: 124, question: "What's the advantage of segmented 90s in large conduit?", answer: "Each smaller bend is easier to make, reduces wall stress, and dramatically improves wire pulling." },
  { id: 125, question: "How many shots for a segment 90 in 2\" EMT?", answer: "Typically 3-5 segments. More for longer radius/easier pulling, fewer for tighter spaces." },
  { id: 126, question: "Why does wire-pulling matter in bend planning?", answer: "Excess friction from tight or too many bends makes pulling wire difficult and can damage insulation." },
  { id: 127, question: "What's the ideal sequence for a 3-point saddle?", answer: "Mark center, bend center 45° first, then flip and do the outer 22.5° bends outward from center." },
  { id: 128, question: "How do I estimate bend time for job planning?", answer: "Experienced: 2-3 minutes per bend. Beginner: 5-10 minutes. Add setup and measuring time." },
  { id: 129, question: "What hand bender features matter most?", answer: "Accurate degree markings, solid hook, clear rim notch, correct shoe radius for conduit size." },
  { id: 130, question: "How do I practice bending efficiently?", answer: "Use scrap conduit. Make every common bend type until it becomes automatic." },
  // Continue the pattern to fill 365 days
  { id: 131, question: "What's the relationship between angle and shrink?", answer: "Larger angles = more shrink. 10°: 1/16\", 22.5°: 3/16\", 30°: 1/4\", 45°: 3/8\", 60°: 1/2\" per inch of rise." },
  { id: 132, question: "Why is conduit fill percentage important?", answer: "Over-filled conduit makes wire pulling nearly impossible and damages insulation. Stay under limits." },
  { id: 133, question: "How do I mark multiple identical pieces quickly?", answer: "Stack pipes together, make one mark across all. Use a square for perpendicular lines." },
  { id: 134, question: "What's a common issue with back-to-back 90s?", answer: "Distance between bends not accounting for gain. Measure back-of-bend to back-of-bend." },
  { id: 135, question: "How do I verify conduit is running level?", answer: "Use a torpedo level on the conduit. Check at multiple points on long runs." },
  { id: 136, question: "What's the best surface for hand bending?", answer: "Flat concrete floor. Provides solid footing and a reference for keeping bends in-plane." },
  { id: 137, question: "How do I avoid scratching the conduit while bending?", answer: "Keep bender shoe clean, don't drag conduit across rough surfaces. Minor scratches are okay." },
  { id: 138, question: "What determines 'good' bend quality?", answer: "No kinks, correct angle, in-plane alignment, and meets dimensional requirements." },
  { id: 139, question: "How do I adjust for worn bender markings?", answer: "Re-mark with paint pen or permanent marker. Or tape reference marks to the handle." },
  { id: 140, question: "What's the 'hook' on a bender for?", answer: "Grips the conduit during bending. Must be engaged properly or pipe will slip." },
  { id: 141, question: "How do I make consistent 45° bends every time?", answer: "Use the bender's 45° marking, or when the handle goes from vertical to 45° from floor." },
  { id: 142, question: "What's an 'air gap' in bending?", answer: "Space between conduit and bender shoe during bend. Should be minimal for clean bends." },
  { id: 143, question: "How do I bend near the end of conduit?", answer: "Leave at least 6\" from end. Closer bends don't have enough pipe to grip properly." },
  { id: 144, question: "What's the key to matching multiple offset heights?", answer: "Use the same angle for all and mark precisely. Even small angle variations compound." },
  { id: 145, question: "How do I calculate conduit cut length for a stub-up?", answer: "Stub height + run length - take-up - gain. Verify with test bend on scrap." },
  { id: 146, question: "What happens if I exceed 360° in a run?", answer: "Must add a pull point (junction box). Pulling wire becomes impractical beyond 360°." },

  { id: 152, question: "How do I plan an offset around unknown obstacles?", answer: "Make the first bend, test fit, then calculate the second bend angle based on actual conditions." },
  { id: 153, question: "What's the advantage of a hickey bender?", answer: "Makes smaller radius bends for rigid conduit. Multiple hits create the total bend angle." },
  { id: 154, question: "How does conduit size affect bend difficulty?", answer: "Larger sizes require more force. Consider mechanical benders for 1-1/4\" and above." },
  { id: 155, question: "What's the minimum radius for 1\" EMT?", answer: "Approximately 5.75 inches. The bender shoe is designed to maintain this minimum." },
